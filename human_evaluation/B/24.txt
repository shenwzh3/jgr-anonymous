Pep Guardiola hit his critics for six as Bayern Munich trounced Porto to reach the Champions League semi-finals on Tuesday night. It was an emphatic statement of intent: the German juggernaught is steaming towards the final in Berlin on June 6. The six goals smashed past the hapless Portuguese pretenders in the quarter-final second leg at the Allianz Arena now takes Bayern's goals total for the season to a spectacular and barely believable 115. And they're not done yet, not by a long way. Bayern still have five Bundesliga matches to play as they march towards a third consecutive title, the German Cup semi-final against Borussia Dortmund on April 28, and potentially three Champions League matches, should they reach the final. If Guardiola's goalscoring machine churns them out at their current rate of 2.61 per game, that would mean an eyewatering total of 141 goals for the season. It isn't Guardiola who should be feeling the pressure - it's the rest of Europe. Here is a breakdown of Bayern's staggering goalscoring so far this season .
